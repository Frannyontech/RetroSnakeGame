# Retro Snake Game

Snake Game was a retro game very popular during the 80s and 90s.
You'll start each game with one green and one red square. The green square is your snake and the red is an apple. Move the snake around the screen and eat as many apples as you can until the screen is full of the snake's body. Each time an apple is eaten, the snake will grow.

## Usage

* The snake will eat the food and grow longer when it reaches the food.
* The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game board.
